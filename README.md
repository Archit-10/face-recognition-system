<h1> Face Recognition using PCA</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>Face Recognition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong> project! In this project, we dive into the exciting world of facial recognition by leveraging PCA, a powerful dimensionality reduction technique. The goal? To create an efficient and reliable facial recognition system capable of identifying individuals from a dataset of grayscale images. Our primary tool for accomplishing this is the concept of "Eigenfaces"-unique components that capture variations across different faces.</p>

<h2> Project Overview</h2> 

<p>This project builds a basic yet effective facial recognition system using the <strong>AT&T Face Dataset</strong>, a popular dataset containing grayscale images of 40 individuals. By reducing high-dimensional face data to a compact "face space," we use PCA to extract principal components, which allows for both efficient image reconstruction and accurate face matching.</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Accurate Face Matching:</strong> Recognizes faces by matching them to a pre-existing database with high precision.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> Reduces the dimensionality of images to extract essential features while preserving accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Dataset</h2>
<p><strong>AT&T Face Dataset:</strong> The dataset consists of grayscale images with dimensions <strong>92x112</strong>, organized into 40 directories (one for each subject). Each directory contains ten images of the subject, taken under varying conditions (lighting, facial expressions, etc.). The dataset can be downloaded <a href="https://link-to-dataset.com">here</a>.</p>

<h2> Steps to Complete the Project</h2>

<h3>1. Load Dataset and Split into Training and Test Sets</h3>
<p><strong>Data Loading:</strong> Load images from the dataset and organize them for processing.<br>
<strong>Train-Test Split:</strong> Divide the dataset to evaluate performance.</p>

<h3>2. Implement PCA Algorithm from Scratch</h3>
<p><strong>PCA Implementation:</strong> Reduce the dimensionality of face images to find principal components (Eigenfaces).</p>

<h3>3. Image Reconstruction Using Eigen Projections</h3>
<p><strong>Reconstruction:</strong> Reconstruct images using eigen projections and visualize differences across various principal components.</p>

<h3>4. Visualize the Mean Face (Eigenface)</h3>
<p><strong>Mean Face:</strong> Calculate and visualize the mean face generated from the dataset.</p>

<h3>5. Face Recognition Module</h3>
<p><strong>Recognition Accuracy:</strong> Identify the closest match from the training set for a test image and evaluate accuracy across different numbers of principal components.</p>

<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>

<p>Working with facial recognition using PCA posed some unique challenges:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Variability:</strong> Variations in lighting, facial expressions, and angles made it difficult to achieve consistent accuracy across all images.</li>
    <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction Trade-offs:</strong> While PCA reduces dimensionality for efficiency, selecting the right number of principal components was crucial to balance performance and accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Implementing PCA from scratch required careful optimization to handle large datasets efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Future Directions</h2>
